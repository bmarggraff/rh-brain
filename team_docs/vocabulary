## Core Terms

### **Phono**

### **Client**

### **Aide / Weaver**
The home care worker supporting the client in person. “Weaver” is a preferred internal term, borrowed from Woven Home Care’s brand language.

### **Household**
The physical and/or logical environment where a Phono deployment takes place. May contain one or more clients and one or more aides, and is used as a scoping boundary for memory and personalization.

### **Contact**
Any person related to the client (e.g., family member, neighbor, clinician) who is relevant to Phono’s memory or interactions.

### **Visit Event**

## Interaction Concepts

### **Tone Tuning**
The act of adapting Phono’s interaction style—volume, cadence, vocabulary, emotional warmth—based on cues from the user or context.

### **Callout Mode**
A configuration that supports temporary or fill-in aides by surfacing briefing-style memory summaries and prompts for fast onboarding.

### **Fallback and Repair**
Strategies Phono uses when it mishears, is unsure, or needs to correct the course of conversation. Includes clarifying questions, graceful topic changes, and subtle re-grounding.

### **Memory Promotion**
The process of elevating a short-term memory (e.g., an utterance or observation) into long-term memory based on relevance, repetition, or user instruction.

## Design Vocabulary

### **Subservient by Default**
A design principle that Phono should defer to humans, especially aides, in tone and decision-making—even while offering helpful suggestions.

### **Silent Companionship**
Phono’s default mode when unsure whether to speak—observing respectfully and engaging only when the context is clear or the user initiates.

### **Eyes Talking**

## Behavioral Concepts

### **Emotional Spike**
An observed moment of significant emotional change (e.g., sadness, joy, anxiety), flagged for memory or future retrieval.

### **Context Weighting**
Prioritizing memory entries and responses based on recency, relevance to current topic, emotional tone, and user identity.

### **Observation-First**
A guiding principle that Phono should gather input and infer before acting—minimizing unnecessary prompts or interventions.

## Business / Product Concepts

### **IDN at Home**
A long-term vision where Phono is part of a vertically integrated care model—providing companionship, data capture, care navigation, and light medical insight under one roof.

### **RAG Doc**
Retrieval-Augmented Generation document. Structured reference material stored for model access during live conversations.

### **System Prompt / System Intro**
The base configuration of behavior and tone provided to Phono’s language model at the start of every session. Sets rules of engagement and contextual goals.
