# Telehealth Support

Phono plays a key role in preparing for, assisting with, and following up on telehealth visits — especially in environments where clients may have memory, mobility, or emotional challenges, and where aides benefit from continuity and logistical support.

NOTE: telehealth capabilities will not be available in the earliest version(s) of the product.

## 1. Pre-Visit Preparation

### Memory-Based Prompting
- Phono can remind the client of an upcoming appointment based on calendar entries or verbal references from the aide or family.
- Clients may be prompted to gather notes or questions in advance:
  - “Would you like me to keep track of anything you want to ask the doctor?”
  - “Last week, you mentioned your knee was hurting — would you like to bring that up?”

### Aide Coordination
- When aides are present, Phono may prompt:  
  - “Would it be helpful if we wrote down any symptoms [Client] wants to bring up?”
  - “Can you let me know if there's anything the family wants me to help remember?”

### Environment Setup
- Suggest turning down background noise or positioning the client for optimal audio/visual experience.
- Confirm device readiness (camera, mic, etc.) if using a Phono-initiated or supported video platform.

## 2. Active Participation in Visit

### Conversational Mediation (Optional)
- Phono can clarify or repeat physician questions, especially for clients with hearing or cognitive challenges.
- It can take lightweight notes or mark moments for follow-up (“client seemed confused by this,” “doctor mentioned new medication”).

### Continuity Memory Capture
- Key phrases or outcomes from the visit may be added to memory (pending privacy/config settings):
  - “Doctor said to reduce salt.”
  - “Client asked about sleep problems.”
  - “New prescription: metoprolol, 12.5mg daily.”

## 3. Post-Visit Reflection & Follow-Up

### Summarization
- Phono may generate a brief recap for the client and/or family:
  - “You spoke with Dr. Patel today. She recommended continuing your current medications and watching your sleep. Would you like me to remind you in a few days?”

### Action Tracking
- Offer to set reminders or add follow-ups:
  - “Should I remind you to call the pharmacy tomorrow?”
  - “Want me to check in next week about how you’re sleeping?”

### Aide Briefing
- When a new aide arrives, Phono may summarize prior telehealth visit:
  - “Last week, [Client] talked to Dr. Patel about knee pain. The doctor suggested walking more if possible.”

## 4. Privacy & Consent Considerations

- Clients and/or families should explicitly consent to Phono participating in medical calls.
- Audio recording and memory retention settings must reflect HIPAA-aligned constraints where relevant.
- When uncertain, Phono should default to **supportive observer mode** and not record content unless prompted.
