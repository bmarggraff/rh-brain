# Family Coordination

Phono facilitates connection, clarity, and continuity across family members who support a client’s care — whether through hands-on visits, remote check-ins, or delegated responsibility to aides or care managers. It acts as a communication buffer, status relay, and relationship anchor.

## 1. Role of Family Members

Family involvement varies widely. Some are deeply engaged and local; others are distant, overworked, or emotionally strained. Phono must accommodate:
- Primary family caregivers
- Rotating family visitors
- Adult children managing from afar
- Designated decision-makers

Each Contact entity may include role tags like: `medical_proxy`, `financial_supporter`, `frequent_visitor`, or `call_only`.

## 2. Supported Coordination Scenarios

### Routine Updates
- Generate short summaries for family members, either auto-generated or prompted by aides:
  - “Today [Client] talked a lot about their childhood. They were in a great mood.”
  - “We noticed they skipped lunch again.”

### Real-Time Check-Ins
- Facilitate family video calls with minimal friction:
  - “Would you like to call Sarah now?”
  - “She left a message this morning — want to hear it?”

- Robot navigates (or points camera) toward the client when a call is started, with consent.

### Family-to-Aide Notes
- Family members may relay instructions or preferences to the aide via Phono:
  - “Mom’s OT is tomorrow — can you remind her to do stretches today?”
  - “Please remind the aide that Dad doesn’t like sweet cereal.”

Phono stores these messages temporarily or as tagged memory entries (e.g., `source:family`, `topic:food_preferences`).

## 3. Continuity During Transitions

When an aide changes or new staff fill in:
- Phono can brief the incoming caregiver using family-provided context.
- “Client prefers to be called Mr. L. and gets agitated when rushed during bathing.”
- “Daughter visits every Tuesday afternoon and brings special snacks.”

---

## 4. Memory Integration

- **Tagged Memory**: Phono captures family names, visit patterns, preferences, tensions (e.g., “client got upset after brother called”), and common topics.
- **Event Logging**: Family visits and calls are logged as `visit_event` or `interaction_event`, optionally with metadata like mood or activity during interaction.
- **Cross-Entity References**:
  - Contacts may be associated with households (e.g., two siblings in different cities both listed as `family`).

---

## 5. Boundaries & Privacy

- Phono **should not volunteer personal updates** to family unless:
  - Explicitly prompted by the client or aide.
  - The information is non-sensitive and previously shared openly.
- Phono **never shares other family members’ commentary** (e.g., gossip, complaints).
- “Would you like me to tell your daughter that you’re feeling a little down today?” is preferable to automatic notifications.

---

## 6. Example Prompts and Flows

- From Client:
  - “Can you call my son?”
  - “Tell my daughter I’m feeling better.”
  - “Remind me when my daughter visits next.”

- From Aide:
  - “Make a note for the family: he didn’t eat lunch again.”
  - “Send the family a summary of today’s session.”

- From Family:
  - “Check if Dad remembered to take his pills.”
  - “Let the aide know I’ll be running late today.”

## Related Components

- **Entities**: `client`, `family`, `aide`, `visit_event`
- **Memory Tags**: `source:family`, `topic:relationship`, `sentiment:comforting`, `confidence:confirmed`
- **RAG Docs**:
  - `aide_guidance`: for understanding family role boundaries
  - `dementia_support`: for navigating memory and relational dynamics
- **Interaction Rules**:
  - Family comments never override client preferences without proper permissions.
