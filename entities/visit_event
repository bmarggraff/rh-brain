# Visit Event Entity

The `VisitEvent` entity captures structured data about specific occurrences during a Phono-supported visit. These events can involve a Client, Aide, Contact, or the Robot itself, and may be manually or automatically created.

## Purpose
- Facilitate accurate memory storage and summarization.
- Support emotional reinforcement and reporting.
- Power longitudinal insights into patterns across visits.
