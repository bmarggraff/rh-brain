# Entity: Family

## Summary
A Family member is any person in the client’s personal support network who is not a paid aide. This may include adult children, spouses, siblings, or close friends involved in care decisions or emotional support. Family may be primary decision-makers, serve as backup caregivers, or simply want occasional updates.

## Key Attributes
- **Name**: Full name or preferred name.
- **Relation to Client**: Daughter, son, spouse, sibling, friend, etc.
- **Contact Information**: Phone number(s), email, optional address.
- **Role**: Describes how involved they are (e.g., "primary decision-maker," "visits weekly," "emotional support only").
- **Permissions**: What types of updates or interactions they’ve authorized or requested (e.g., photo sharing, health updates).
- **Preferred Contact Method & Time**: How/when they prefer to be reached.
- **Associated Client(s)**: Most will only be linked to one client, but in some cases (e.g. couples) may be associated with more.

## Behaviors & Edge Cases
- May initiate interactions with the robot (e.g., checking in, video call prompts).
- May be present during in-home visits or sessions.
- May have conflicting preferences from the client or other family members (e.g., more or less tech use).
- May use their own mobile app or portal to review or interact with system summaries.
- May change over time (e.g., one sibling becomes more involved).

## Memory Interactions
- Family members can be remembered as important figures in the client’s life, with emotionally resonant references ("Your daughter Sarah called this morning").
- May be referenced in reminders, rituals, or social stories ("You talked with your grandson Jack yesterday about his soccer game").
